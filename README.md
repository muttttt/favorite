# Muay Thai
> Muay Thai is a buddhist combat sport where anything standing is allowed.
### Why I like Muay thai
- Injury avoidance. ironically a buddhist combat sport, the point is to learn and improve, never to injure someone else.
- Community. The gym for me has been a great, comfortable learning environment where everyone is willing to teach.
- Inclusion. Overall, I've found the muay thai community in specific to be incredibly inclusive. 
Regardless of background, disabilities or age, everyone gets the same quality in training.
